# ðŸ§® Quadratic Equation Solver with xUnit Tests

This project is a simple C# console application that calculates the real roots of a quadratic equation of the form:

The project also includes a comprehensive unit test suite using **xUnit** to verify different scenarios including:

- No real roots
- One real root (discriminant = 0)
- Two distinct real roots

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Solves any quadratic equation with real coefficients.
- Provides meaningful messages for each case.
- Fully tested with xUnit.
- Demonstrates best practices in unit testing: **[Fact]**, **[Theory]**, `Arrange-Act-Assert`, and clean assertions.

---

## ðŸ§ª Unit Testing

Unit tests cover all the edge cases using `xUnit` and are designed to follow best practices such as:

- Isolated and repeatable tests
- Use of `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]` for parameterized test cases
- Clear test naming conventions

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- .NET 6 / .NET Core
- C#
- xUnit
- Rider / Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub
